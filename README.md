# Spotify Recents Grouper

A sleek and modern web application that lets you connect to your Spotify account and explore your recently played tracks. Built with Next.js, this app provides a polished user experience with a vibe that's as smooth as your favorite playlist.

# Why?
On a good day, spotify suggestions are just hit different. Banger after banger and you just wish you could save that particular order of tunes in a playlist for another day (cz you know that you won't get such suggestions in a looooong time). 

This app helps you do just that.
